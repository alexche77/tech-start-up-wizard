# Tech Start-up Builder

Trello board: https://trello.com/b/bQmJinMK/tech-startup-rooster

## Vision:

Do you have an awesome start up idea that you want to build up and need help figuring out the dream team?

No worries, we can help you out, just answer a couple of questions, and we will do some magic using torre.co awesome API.

Basically we will put together all the team, taking in consideration all the answers you gave us when you created the 
startup.

### Devlog?

Day 1: 
Recieved the email and I could not believe how hard this test was going to be, because I had to come with something up.
I did not want to do the usual stuff, a search, a job listing app, I wanted to give it a little more fun.

So the idea is simple, given a couple of parameters that the user specifies when entering the startup details, we go
and use the torre.co api to search for best coincidences, the final idea would have a better ui, seed capital vs actual cost 
based on the MVP deliverable date, etc.

Day 2: 

After some sleep, I bootstrapped the project with laravel, I did not think I had enough time to execute with frontend
backend approach, so I went full SSR.
